Failing coding assessments in the first-level interviews is a very common struggle—so first of all, don’t be too hard on yourself. With the right strategy, you can definitely improve and start cracking them consistently.

Let’s break it down step by step.

🔍 Why Coding Assessments Feel Hard

Time Pressure – You have limited time to understand, plan, and code.
Unfamiliar Patterns – Questions seem "new" even though they follow common patterns.
Lack of Practice – If you’re not solving problems regularly, your thinking doesn’t become second nature.

✅ How to Understand the Questions

Here’s how you can train yourself to decode questions better:

1. Slow Down & Read Twice
  First read: Get the overall idea of the problem.
  Second read: Look for inputs, expected outputs, and constraints (e.g., "array size is 10^5" — this hints at using O(n) solutions).

2. Write an Example
  Take sample input and output and try to do it manually. This helps clarify what the question is actually asking.

3. Identify the Pattern
  Most problems fall into certain patterns. Learn to classify the question:
  Is it a string manipulation?
  Is it a search problem? (Binary Search, DFS, BFS)
  Is it dynamic programming?
  Does it need a stack or queue?
  Is it a greedy algorithm problem?

🔁 How to Prepare for These Questions

🔹 Step 1: Master the Basics

  Practice these categories from easy to medium on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces:
  Arrays & Strings
  HashMaps & Sets
  Two Pointers & Sliding Window
  Stack & Queue
  Recursion & Backtracking
  Binary Search
  Sorting
  Trees & Graphs
  Dynamic Programming (basic first)

🔹 Step 2: Use Structured Resources

  Here's a simple roadmap:
  DSA Sheet by Love Babbar (very popular for interview prep)
  NeetCode 150 on LeetCode (very organized)
  Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet (progressive learning)
  
🔹 Step 3: Practice Mock Assessments

  Use Timed Practice on LeetCode.
  Join contests like LeetCode Weekly/Monthly Contests.
  Try HackerRank "Interview Preparation Kit".

💡 Smart Tips
  Don't start coding immediately. First plan your logic.
  Write clean code – use proper variable names, indentation.
  Edge cases – Think about empty arrays, nulls, very large inputs, etc.
  Debugging – Get comfortable with printing and tracing logic during practice.

🧠 Thinking Process to Develop
  When you see a question, ask yourself:
  What are the inputs/outputs?
  Can I solve this manually for 2-3 test cases?
  What’s the brute force approach?
  Can I optimize it? (Better time/space)
  Which data structure or algorithm fits?
