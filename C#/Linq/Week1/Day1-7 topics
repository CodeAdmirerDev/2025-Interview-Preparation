Week 1: LINQ Basics, with detailed concepts, simple examples, and interview-focused questions.

âœ… Day 1â€“2: Introduction to LINQ

What is LINQ?
LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query. 
It is a powerful feature in C# and VB.NET that enables you to work with data from different sources (like arrays, collections, databases, XML, etc.) in a consistent and cohesive way. 
LINQ simplifies querying and manipulating data by providing a unified syntax that you can use across various data types and formats.

Key Features of LINQ
        Integrated Syntax:
        LINQ queries can be written directly in your programming language, making them more readable and easier to understand.
        
        Strongly Typed:
        Since LINQ is integrated into C#, it benefits from compile-time checking, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors compared to dynamic query languages like SQL.
        
        Deferred Execution:
        In many cases, LINQ queries do not execute until the data is actually needed. This allows for optimized performance.
        
        Supports Various Data Sources:
        LINQ can be used with collections (like lists and arrays), databases (via LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework), XML (via LINQ to XML), and more.
        
        Method Syntax and Query Syntax:
        LINQ provides two main syntaxes for writing queries: query syntax (similar to SQL) and method syntax (using extension methods).

Summary
LINQ is a powerful feature that enhances productivity and code readability by allowing developers to query collections and databases in a unified way. 
It reduces the complexity of data manipulation and makes it easier to express complex queries in a more intuitive manner.

For example Instead of:
foreach (var emp in employees)
{
    if (emp.Age > 30)
        result.Add(emp);
}

You write:
var result = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 30).ToList();

Why Use LINQ?
    Readable & Maintainable Code:
            Clear Syntax: LINQ provides a declarative syntax that is often more intuitive and easier to read compared to traditional looping and conditional logic.
            Reduced Boilerplate: By minimizing the amount of code required to perform common data operations (like filtering, projection, and aggregation), LINQ enhances maintainability.
            Descriptive Queries: Queries can be expressed in a way that closely resembles natural language or SQL, making it easier for developers to understand the intent of the code at a glance.

    Type-safe & IntelliSense Support:
    
            Compile-time Checking: LINQ is integrated into C#, which means that queries are type-checked at compile time. This helps catch errors early in the development process, reducing runtime exceptions.
            IntelliSense: When using LINQ in an IDE like Visual Studio, developers benefit from IntelliSense, which provides suggestions and method signatures as you type. This speeds up development and minimizes errors.
    
    Consistent Syntax Across Data Sources:
            Unified Query Experience: LINQ offers a consistent syntax for querying different data sources, whether it's in-memory collections (like lists), SQL databases, XML documents, or other data providers. This reduces the learning curve when switching between different data contexts.
            Adaptability: With LINQ, you can easily switch the data source without changing the logic of your queries. The same LINQ syntax applies regardless of the underlying data structure.
    
    Powerful Query Abstraction:
            Rich Query Operators: LINQ provides a wide range of operators for filtering, ordering, grouping, and transforming data, allowing for complex queries to be constructed succinctly.
            Composability: LINQ queries can be easily composed and chained together, making it simple to build complex queries step-by-step.

    Performance Benefits:
            Deferred Execution: Many LINQ operations use deferred execution, meaning they donâ€™t run until the data is actually needed. This can lead to performance optimizations, as unnecessary computations may be avoided.
            Efficient Database Queries: When using LINQ with Entity Framework or LINQ to SQL, the generated SQL queries are optimized for execution against the database, often leading to better performance compared to manually constructed SQL queries.
    
    Cross-Platform with .NET Core:
            Wide Applicability: LINQ can be used in various .NET applications, whether they are desktop, web, or cloud-based. Itâ€™s a versatile tool across different types of projects.
            
Conclusion
Using LINQ not only improves code readability and maintainability, but it also enhances developer productivity through type safety, IntelliSense support, and a consistent querying experience across different data types. 
This makes LINQ a valuable feature for any C# or VB.NET developer.

ðŸ”¹ Types of LINQ

Type	              Description
LINQ to Objects    	    Query in-memory collections (List, Array)
LINQ to SQL	Query       SQL Server databases
LINQ to Entities	    Query databases via Entity Framework
LINQ to XML        	    Query XML data

Now,Will gothrough the each type and it's features:

    LINQ to Objects
        Description: LINQ to Objects allows you to query in-memory collections like arrays, lists, and other types that implement IEnumerable<T>.
        Features:
        Works directly with .NET collections such as List<T>, Array, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, etc.
        Supports deferred execution and query composition.
        Example Use Case: Filtering a list of customer records stored in memory.
        Example:
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };  
        var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);  

    LINQ to SQL
        Description: LINQ to SQL is a component of .NET that allows you to query SQL Server databases using LINQ syntax.
        Features:
        Maps .NET classes to database tables and enables strongly typed queries against the SQL Server.
        Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
        Example Use Case: Retrieving and manipulating data from a SQL Server database.
        Example:
        using (var context = new YourDataContext())  
        {  
            var customers = from c in context.Customers  
                            where c.City == "New York"  
                            select c;  
        }  

    LINQ to Entities
        Description: LINQ to Entities allows you to use LINQ queries against data sources defined in the Entity Framework. 
                    It provides a higher-level abstraction than LINQ to SQL.
        Features:
        Works with various database systems through Entity Framework, not just SQL Server.
        Supports advanced features like lazy loading, change tracking, and relationships between entities.
        Example Use Case: Querying a relational database using an object-relational mapping (ORM) model.
        Example:
        using (var context = new YourDbContext())  
        {  
            var orders = from o in context.Orders  
                         where o.OrderDate > DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1)  
                         select o;  
        }  
    
    LINQ to XML
        Description: LINQ to XML provides a straightforward way to query and manipulate XML data using LINQ syntax.
        Features:
        Allows easy querying, transforming, and creating XML trees.
        Supports both LINQ queries and XML-specific methods for working with XML documents.
        Example Use Case: Reading and processing XML files, such as configuration files or data feeds.
        Example:
        XElement xml = XElement.Load("data.xml");  
        var items = from item in xml.Elements("Item")  
                    where (string)item.Element("Category") == "Electronics"  
                    select (string)item.Element("Name");  

Conclusion
These different types of LINQ allow for versatile querying capabilities across various data sources, whether in-memory collections, SQL databases, or XML documents. 
This flexibility is one of the key strengths of LINQ, simplifying the development process and enhancing code readability.

ðŸ”¹ Query Syntax vs Method Syntax in LINQ

    Query Syntax: 
        Description: This syntax resembles SQL and provides a declarative way to express queries. It's often easier for those familiar with SQL.
        Structure: It uses keywords such as from, where, select, and orderby.
        Example:
        var result = from e in employees  
                     where e.Age > 30  
                     select e.Name;  
        Use Cases: Query syntax is often more intuitive for simple queries or for those new to LINQ who have a background in SQL. 
                   It also makes it easy to visualize complex queries with multiple joins and groupings.

    Method Syntax (Fluent):
        Description: This syntax uses extension methods available in the LINQ library and is based on method chaining (fluent interface).
        Structure: It consists of method calls chained together with dot operators, such as Where(), Select(), OrderBy(), etc.
        Example:
        var result = employees  
                     .Where(e => e.Age > 30)  
                     .Select(e => e.Name);  
        Use Cases: Method syntax is more versatile and powerful, especially for complex queries that involve multiple transformations and aggregations. 
                   It allows for seamless integration with other LINQ features and is commonly used in modern .NET development.

Comparison

Feature	                         Query Syntax	                                        Method Syntax
Readability	                More readable for those familiar with SQL	                Can be more concise but may require more familiarity with LINQ methods
Complex Queries	            Easier to express complex queries with multiple joins	    Provides flexibility and chaining for complex operations
IntelliSense Support	    Limited based on keywords	                                Full IntelliSense support for extension methods
Performance	                Generally similar in terms of performance	                Also similar; optimizations apply to both methods
Use Cases	                Good for straightforward, SQL-like queries	                Better for complex data transformations and manipulations

Conclusion
Both Query Syntax and Method Syntax achieve the same results in LINQ queries, and which one to use often depends on personal preference or specific use case. 
While Query Syntax can be more natural for those with a SQL background, Method Syntax is generally favored in modern C# development for its flexibility, chaining capabilities, and IntelliSense support.
âœ… Both do the same. Method syntax is more powerful and widely used.


âœ… Day 3â€“4: Basic Operations
Assume:
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

ðŸ”¹ Where
        Where filters a collection to include only elements that satisfy a condition.
        Example:
            int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };  
            var even = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);  
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", even));  // Output: 2, 4, 6  
        
        It returns only the even numbers from the original collection.

ðŸ”¹ Select
        Select transforms each item in a collection into a new form.
        Example:
            int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
            var squares = numbers.Select(n => n * n);  
            
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", squares));  // Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25  
        Each number is squared, creating a new collection of the squared values.
        
ðŸ”¹ Take & Skip
        Take(n): Returns the first n elements from the collection.
        Skip(n): Skips the first n elements and returns the rest.
        Example:
            int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };  
            
            var firstThree = numbers.Take(3);  // { 1, 2, 3 }  
            var skipTwo = numbers.Skip(2);     // { 3, 4, 5, 6 }  
            
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", firstThree));  // Output: 1, 2, 3  
            Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", skipTwo));     // Output: 3, 4, 5, 6  
        
        Summary:
        Use Take to get a subset from the start, and Skip to ignore elements at the start.
        
ðŸ”¹ First, FirstOrDefault
        First: Returns the first element in the collection that matches the condition.Throws an exception if no match is found.
        FirstOrDefault: Returns the first element that matches the condition, or the default value (e.g., 0 for int, null for reference types) if none found.
        
        Example:
            int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
            
            // First even number  
            int firstEven = numbers.First(n => n % 2 == 0);  
            // firstEven = 2 (the first even number)  
            
            // First number greater than 10, none found, returns default (0)  
            int firstOrDefault = numbers.FirstOrDefault(n => n > 10);  
            // firstOrDefault = 0 (default int value)  
            
            Console.WriteLine(firstEven);       // Output: 2  
            Console.WriteLine(firstOrDefault);  // Output: 0  
        Summary:
        Use First when you expect at least one matching element.
        Use FirstOrDefault when there might be none and you want to avoid exceptions.

ðŸ”¹ Single, SingleOrDefault
        Hereâ€™s a clearer explanation:
        Single and SingleOrDefault expect exactly one element matching the condition.
            
            // Finds the single number equal to 4  
            int result = numbers.Single(n => n == 4);  // result = 4  
            Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 4 
            
            // Finds the single number equal to 4  
            int result1 = numbers.SingleOrDefault(n => n == 4);  // result1 = 4  
            // Tries to find a number equal to 10 (which doesn't exist)  
            int result2 = numbers.SingleOrDefault(n => n == 10); // result2 = 0 (default int value)  
            Console.WriteLine(result1); // Output: 4  
            Console.WriteLine(result2); // Output: 0  
        
        Important:
        If no elements match, Single throws an exception (SingleOrDefault returns default value, e.g., null or 0).
        If more than one element matches, both throw an exception.
        So use these when you are sure thereâ€™s exactly one matching item.
        

âœ… Day 5â€“6: Filtering and Projection
Assume:
class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

var employees = new List<Employee>
{
    new Employee { Id = 1, Name = "John", Age = 28 },
    new Employee { Id = 2, Name = "Jane", Age = 35 },
    new Employee { Id = 3, Name = "Smith", Age = 40 }
};

ðŸ”¹ Filtering using Where
var seniorEmployees = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 30);

        Process:
        Where Method: The Where method filters the employees collection based on the condition specified in the lambda expression (e => e.Age > 30). It returns a new collection containing only the employees who meet this condition.
        Employees added to the seniorEmployees variable are those whose age is greater than 30.
        Expected Output:
                Senior Employees:  
                Bob  
                David  

ðŸ”¹ Projecting using Select
var names = employees.Select(e => e.Name);

        Process:
        Select Method: The Select method projects each employee to a string containing just their name. It transforms the original employees collection into a collection of strings (the names).
        Expected Output:
                All Employee Names:  
                Alice  
                Bob  
                Charlie  
                David  

ðŸ”¹ Anonymous Types

var nameAndAge = employees
    .Where(e => e.Age > 30)
    .Select(e => new { e.Name, e.Age });

foreach (var item in nameAndAge)
    Console.WriteLine($"{item.Name} - {item.Age}");

        Process:
        Filtering with Where: The employees are filtered to only include those older than 30.
        Projecting with Select: New anonymous types are created with properties Name and Age for filtered employees, encapsulating these fields into temporary objects.
        
        Expected Output:
                Name and Age of Senior Employees:  
                Bob - 32  
                David - 35  

Summary
Filtering with Where: Limits the collection to those employees who fit a specific criteria (in this case, age).
Projecting with Select: Transforms an entire collection into a different form (like just names).
Using Anonymous Types: Allows you to work with multiple properties without defining a formal class, which is useful for encapsulating related data within a query.

âœ… Day 7: Practice Problems

ðŸ”¸ Problem 1: Select all numbers greater than 10
var result = numbers.Where(n => n > 10);

ðŸ”¸ Problem 2: Get names of employees older than 30
var result = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 30)
                      .Select(e => e.Name);
ðŸ”¸ Problem 3: Get first even number
var result = numbers.First(n => n % 2 == 0);

ðŸ”¸ Problem 4: Skip first 2 elements and take next 3
var result = numbers.Skip(2).Take(3);

ðŸ”¸ Problem 5: Get employee with Id = 2
var result = employees.Single(e => e.Id == 2);

    What is the difference between First and FirstOrDefault?
    When would you use Single over First?
    Explain query syntax vs method syntax. Which is better?
    What is the benefit of anonymous types in LINQ?
    How does Where work in LINQ and how is it different from SQL WHERE?
    Whatâ€™s deferred execution in LINQ? (preview for Week 4)
    

ðŸ”¹ 1. What is the difference between First and FirstOrDefault?

Feature	                    First	                        FirstOrDefault
Throws Exception	    If no match found	                Returns default value (null, 0, etc.)
Use Case	            When you are sure an item exists	When the result may be empty

Example:
var nums = new List<int> { };

// First - throws InvalidOperationException
var a = nums.First();            

// FirstOrDefault - returns 0 (default of int)
var b = nums.FirstOrDefault();  
âœ… Use FirstOrDefault when you're not sure if the item exists.

ðŸ”¹ 2. When would you use Single over First?

Both Single and First are LINQ methods used to retrieve elements from a collection, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of when to use each method and the key differences between them.

        1. Single Method
                
                Purpose: Use Single when you expect exactly one element to satisfy the provided condition. If there are no matching elements or if there is more than one match, Single will throw an InvalidOperationException.
                Use Cases:
                When you are querying for a unique entity (like an employee with a unique ID).
                When violating the expectation of having zero or multiple results needs to be explicitly handled as an error.
                Example:
                var employee = employees.Single(e => e.Id == 2);  
        
        2. First Method

                Purpose: Use First when you want to retrieve the first element that satisfies the condition. If no matching elements are found, First will throw an InvalidOperationException. If there are multiple matches, First returns the first occurrence.
                Use Cases:
                When it is acceptable to have more than one matching item but you only care about the first one.
                When querying for a list where the element may not be unique, but you're looking for a quick check.
                Example:
                 var firstEmployee = employees.First(e => e.Department == "Sales"); 
                
                When to Use Each Method
                Use Single:
                
                When querying for unique records by keys (e.g., looking up a user by a unique identifier).
                When the business logic dictates that there should be one and only one matching element.
                
                Use First:
                When you're looking for the first occurrence in a collection and expect that it's common to have multiple matches.
                When the context does not require uniqueness, and you are only interested in one result.
                
ðŸ”¹ 3. Explain query syntax vs method syntax. Which is better?

Query syntax and method syntax are two ways to write LINQ queries in C#. Each has its advantages and scenarios where it may be more appropriate. Here's a breakdown of both syntaxes, including their structures, use cases, and comparisons to help you understand which might be better for specific situations.

        1. Query Syntax
                Description: Query syntax resembles SQL. It uses keywords like from, where, select, and orderby, making it look similar to traditional SQL queries.
                Structure:
                var results = from e in employees  
                              where e.Age > 30  
                              orderby e.Name  
                              select e.Name;  
                
                Characteristics:
                Familiarity: It's easier to read for those who are familiar with SQL.
                Declarative: The focus is on what to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it.
                Supports Grouping and Joins: You can express complex queries (joins, groups) more transparently.
                Use Cases: Best for straightforward queries, especially if the reader is familiar with SQL.
                
        2. Method Syntax (Fluent)
                Description: Method syntax uses method chaining with extension methods (like Where, Select, OrderBy, etc.). Itâ€™s fluent and allows for a more functional programming style.
                
                Structure:
                
                csharp
                var results = employees  
                             .Where(e => e.Age > 30)  
                             .OrderBy(e => e.Name)  
                             .Select(e => e.Name);  
                
                Characteristics:
                Compactness: Often more concise and expressive, especially for complex queries.
                Powerful Compositions: You can easily chain multiple operations and use lambda expressions for more complex logic.
                IntelliSense Support: Provides full IntelliSense, which can speed up development.
                Use Cases: Preferable for more complex queries that require intricate transformations or when using a functional programming approach.
                

        âœ… Which is better?
        Query syntax is readable for simple queries (like SQL).
        Method syntax supports complex operations, chaining, and all features (like GroupJoin, Aggregate).
        ðŸ‘‰ Method syntax is preferred in real-world apps.
        Neither syntax is objectively better; the choice depends on context and personal preferences. Here are some considerations:

        Choose Query Syntax when:
        You are dealing with straightforward queries or have team members familiar with SQL.
        You are performing complex operations involving grouping or joining that are easier to express using SQL-like syntax.

        Choose Method Syntax when:
        You want to take advantage of the chaining abilities for more complex data transformations.
        You prefer a functional programming style or require IntelliSense support, especially when writing more complex logic.

ðŸ”¹ 4. What is the benefit of anonymous types in LINQ?

Benefits of Anonymous Types in LINQ
        Anonymous types in C# are useful for creating simple objects without needing to explicitly define a class. This feature brings several benefits, especially in the context of LINQ queries.
        
        1. Projection of Specific Fields
        Description: With anonymous types, you can project only the fields you need from an existing object or collection, which helps to minimize data transfer and processing.

        Example:
        var result = employees.Select(e => new { e.Name, e.Age });  
        // result is a collection of anonymous types containing only the Name and Age properties.  
        
        2. Temporary Objects
        Description: Anonymous types are great for creating temporary objects that donâ€™t need to be defined as part of your application's data model. Instead of creating classes for one-time use, you can directly create instances on the fly.
        Example:
        var nameAndAge = employees  
            .Where(e => e.Age > 30)  
            .Select(e => new { e.Name, e.Age });  
        
        foreach (var item in nameAndAge)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.Name} - {item.Age}");  
        }  
        
        3. Reduction of Boilerplate Code
        Description: By using anonymous types, you reduce the boilerplate code associated with defining data structures. This is particularly helpful in scenarios where the shape of the data is straightforward and doesn't require a complete class definition.
        Example:
        Instead of defining a full class for employee details like this:
        public class EmployeeDetails  
        {  
            public string Name { get; set; }  
            public int Age { get; set; }  
        }  
        You can create anonymous types directly in your LINQ query without cluttering your code with unnecessary class definitions.
        
        4. Type Inference
        Description: C# uses type inference for anonymous types, which means you donâ€™t have to specify the type explicitly. The compiler automatically creates the appropriate type based on the properties defined.
        Example:
        var tempObject = new { Id = 1, Description = "Temporary item" };  
        // The type of tempObject is inferred, and it has properties Id and Description.  
        
        Use Cases for Anonymous Types
        Data Display: When retrieving data for UI display purposes where only certain fields are needed.
        Ad-Hoc Queries: Useful in scenarios where data shapes change frequently or are only needed for a short time (like in data transformations, filtering, or summarization).
        Combining Fields: When combining fields from different sources into a single object for return without requiring a class definition.
        
        Conclusion
        Anonymous types are an essential feature in C#, especially for LINQ queries. They provide:
        Flexibility and simplicity for working with temporary data structures.
        The ability to focus on relevant data without cluttering code with numerous class definitions.
        A convenient way to streamline data handling when working with collections.
        

ðŸ”¹ 5. How does Where work in LINQ and how is it different from SQL WHERE?

Understanding Where in LINQ

        How Where Works in LINQ
        Description: The Where method is a filtering operator in LINQ that takes a predicate (a lambda expression returning a boolean value) and applies it to a collection of objects.
        Usage: This method returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the specified condition. The original collection remains unchanged.

        In LINQ: Where() is a filtering operator that takes a lambda expression.
        In SQL: WHERE filters rows at the database level.
        LINQ:
        var adults = employees.Where(e => e.Age >= 18);

        Difference:
        LINQ can filter in-memory collections (LINQ to Objects)
        LINQ to Entities translates .Where() to SQL WHERE
        LINQ offers type safety & compile-time checking
        
        More Key Points:
        In-Memory vs. Database-Level:
        LINQ: The Where method can filter elements from any collection such as arrays, lists, or dictionaries using LINQ to Objects. This allows for operations on data that is already in memory.
        SQL: The WHERE clause operates at the database level, filtering the data as it is retrieved from the database. This means the filtering happens remotely, potentially reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network.
        
        Type Safety and Compile-Time Checking:
        LINQ: Since LINQ queries are written in C#, they benefit from the type checking provided by the compiler. This means that errors related to types can be caught during development rather than at runtime, enhancing reliability.
        SQL: SQL queries are often executed directly against a database, and syntax or logical errors in the query itself may only become apparent when the query is run.
        
        Deferred Execution:
        LINQ: The Where method utilizes deferred execution, meaning that the query is not executed until the resulting collection is specifically enumerated (for example, in a foreach loop or when converted to a list).
        SQL: The WHERE clause executes immediately when the SQL statement is run, fetching only the filtered rows from the database.
        
        Language Features:
        LINQ: Supports powerful language features like lambda expressions, anonymous types, and strongly-typed collections, allowing for more complex operations within the query.
        SQL: While SQL can perform complex queries through joins and subqueries, it lacks features like lambda expressions and type safety inherent in C#.

        Conclusion
        The Where method in LINQ is a powerful and flexible way to filter in-memory collections, providing the added benefit of type safety and compile-time checking. In contrast, the SQL WHERE clause operates at the database level, determining which rows to return from a query. Understanding these differences is crucial when deciding how to approach filtering data in your applications, whether working with in-memory objects or querying a database.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Whatâ€™s deferred execution in LINQ? (Preview of Week 4)

        What is Deferred Execution in LINQ?
        Definition: Deferred execution in LINQ means that the evaluation of a query is delayed until you actually enumerate (access or iterate over) the results. 
        When you construct a LINQ query, it does not execute immediately. 
        Instead, it prepares the query expression, and the actual execution occurs only when you iterate over the results, such as in a foreach loop, 
        or when methods like ToList() or ToArray() are called.
        
        Why Use Deferred Execution?
        Performance:
        Efficiency: Since the query is only executed when needed, unnecessary computations can be avoided. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or expensive operations, as the data is only processed when truly necessary.
        Optimizations: The underlying data can change between the time the query is defined and the time it is executed, allowing LINQ to reflect the most up-to-date data without needing to redefine the query.
        
        Flexibility:
        The query can adapt to changes. If the underlying data source (e.g., a database or a collection) is modified, the next iteration will reflect those changes, ensuring that the results are always current.
        
        Example of Deferred Execution
        Here is a detailed example that demonstrates deferred execution:
                
        class Program  
        {  
            static void Main()  
            {  
                // Sample data: List of employees  
                var employees = new List<Employee>  
                {  
                    new Employee { Name = "Alice", Age = 28 },  
                    new Employee { Name = "Bob", Age = 35 },  
                    new Employee { Name = "Charlie", Age = 40 },  
                    new Employee { Name = "David", Age = 30 }  
                };  
        
                // Define a LINQ query (not executed yet)  
                var query = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 30);  
        
                // Modify the source collection  
                employees.Add(new Employee { Name = "Eve", Age = 45 });  
        
                // Execution happens here as we iterate over the query  
                Console.WriteLine("Employees over 30:");  
                foreach (var emp in query) // Executes the query and filters  
                {  
                    Console.WriteLine(emp.Name);  
                }  
            }  
        }  
        
        // Employee class definition  
        class Employee  
        {  
            public string Name { get; set; }  
            public int Age { get; set; }  
        }  
        Expected Output:
                Employees over 30:  
                Bob  
                Charlie  
                Eve

        Important Considerations

        Underlying Collection Changes:
        As you noted, if the underlying collection changes after the query is defined but before it is executed, the result of the query will reflect those changes. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.
        
        Performance Implications:
        If the same query is iterated multiple times, it will be executed anew each time, which could lead to performance concerns if the underlying data source involves expensive operations. In such cases, you might want to materialize the result (e.g., using ToList() or ToArray()) to avoid repeated execution.
        
        Query Composition:
        You can compose queries across multiple operations. Each operation can add to the query without executing it until the final iteration. This allows you to build complex queries step-by-step while still benefiting from deferred execution.
        
        Conclusion
        Deferred execution is a powerful feature of LINQ that enhances efficiency and flexibility in data querying. Understanding when and how queries are executed can help you write more performant and reliable code. Always be cautious of changes in the underlying data collection when using deferred execution to avoid unintended consequences.
